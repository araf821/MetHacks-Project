### About Pawsiotherapy

Pawsiotherapy is an online platform for booking therapy sessions with animals to improve mental health. This innovative platform allows users to find and book therapy sessions with various animals, including pets and therapy animals.

Pawsiotherapy is designed to be an affordable and accessible option for people who are seeking therapy but cannot afford expensive therapists. Studies have shown that spending time with animals can have a positive impact on mental health, and we are making this option available to everyone.

The platform is easy to use and features a variety of animals available for therapy sessions. Users can browse through listings, find animals located near them, and book sessions with the animal of their choice. Additionally, users can upload their own pets for others to book sessions with.

Pawsiotherapy is also beneficial for animal shelters, as they can advertise their animals for more recognition and increase their chances of being adopted.
